The Lemonade app is a simple Compose app that allows the user to make digital lemonade by tapping through a series of steps: select a lemon from the tree, squeeze the lemon, drink the glass of lemonade, and start again.

The concepts covered in this app are:

<ul>
        <li>Simple UI layout in Compose</li>
        <li>Add clickable behavior to a composable</li>
        <li>Use remember and mutableStateOf to keep track of relevant state in the app</li>
</ul>
